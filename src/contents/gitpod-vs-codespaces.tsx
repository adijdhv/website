          Gitpod removes long init and build times by continuously pre-building workspaces for your project, allowing you to start coding or
          debugging immediately, from any context, at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply add your build command into a .gitpod.yml file and let Gitpod do the heavy-lifting. Once you’ve experienced the freedom of
          ephemeral workspaces, you’ll never want to go back to long-lived, manually-maintained environments.

          By leveraging cloud technologies like containers and Kubernetes, Gitpod achieves best-in-class resource-efficiency with scalable
          workspaces running on shared high-powered cloud servers (16 vCPU / 60GB RAM as of September 2020).

          Gitpod is not only more resource-efficient but it also runs on 100% carbon-neutral cloud servers (GCP).<sup>1</sup>
